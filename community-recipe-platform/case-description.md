### Case Title
Community Recipe Sharing Platform

### Background
Home cooks often discover great recipes but have no central place to organize and share them with friends and family. Physical recipe cards get lost, and bookmarked websites disappear.

### Purpose
Create a web application where users can save, organize, and share their favorite recipes with a community of cooking enthusiasts.

### Core Functionality - Must Have (MVP)
- User registration and authentication
- Create, read, update, and delete recipes
- Browse all public recipes
- Search recipes by name or ingredient

### Data Requirements
- Users: username, email, password
- Recipes: title, ingredients, instructions, cooking time, creator, visibility (public/private)

### Technical Constraints
- Must be responsive (work on mobile and desktop)
- Must require authentication to create recipes
- Must validate required fields (title, ingredients, instructions)
